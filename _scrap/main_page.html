<h3>Formation</h3>
<p class="pageContent">
  Representatives of four, locally coordinated Animas River watershed groups, together with the Animas River Keeper for the San Juan Citizens Alliance and the Community Liaison for San Juan County (CO) with EPA, are initiating this CAG formation
  process. All of these “formation committee” members have wide-ranging experience with Animas River issues, particularly water quality, and all have extensive contacts throughout the local community with which they can share information. The
  members of the CAG formation committee are:
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Peter Butler, Ph.D. – Coordinator – Animas River Stakeholders Group</li>
      <li>Ty Churchwell – Animas Campaign Coordinator – Trout Unlimited</li>
      <li>Curtis Hartenstine – Board Member – Animas Watershed Partnership</li>
      <li>Shannon Manfredi – Facilitator – Animas River Community Forum</li>
      <li>Marcel Gaztambide – Community Organizer – San Juan Citizens Alliance</li>
      <li>Anthony Edwards, J.D. – Community Liaison – San Juan County and Town of Silverton</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br />

  The formation committee is soliciting applications from people who want to be on the CAG, including applications from the formation committee itself. These applications would be forwarded the four local governments in the Colorado portion of
  the watershed – San Juan County (CO), Town of Silverton, La Plata County and the City of Durango. Each of these entities will pick one person from within their respective jurisdictions to be a CAG member. (The Southern Ute Indian Tribe was
  contacted to gage interest. A representative said that they would like to monitor the CAG activities but did not want to participate in the formation process.) Once those four CAG members are chosen, the formation committee will select the
  rest of the CAG members. We plan to limit the CAG to fifteen people. There is no set limit, but more than fifteen could become unwieldy. <a href="#getInvolved">Click here to submit an application.</a><br /><br />
  The CAG should have a diversity and balance of interests. Therefore, the committee will strive to appoint at least one person with experience in each of the following categories:
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Agriculture</li>
      <li>Mining</li>
      <li>Mine Remediation</li>
      <li>Recreation</li>
      <li>Environment</li>
      <li>Science</li>
      <li>Local Government</li>
      <li>Local Business</li>
      <li>Public Health</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <br />

  We use the word “strive” because there may not always be a good candidate for each one of these categories. In addition, we want to ensure there are plenty of “at large” seats, because some good, qualified citizens may not fall under any of
  these groupings. The committee will also strive to obtain geographic representation from different parts of the Animas River watershed. CAG meetings are open to the public, so meeting participation is not limited to only CAG members. Community
  members and Animas River stakeholders are urged to participate.<br /><br />Generally, the term of appointments to the CAG would be three years with one-third of the appointments expiring each year. The members of the CAG as a whole would vote
  on appointments or re-appointments after the initial formation with the exception of the four members appointed by the local governmental jurisdictions.<br /><br />Operational bylaws such as developing a steering or executive committee,
  determining a quorum for meetings, taking actions (through vote or consensus), etc. would be developed by the CAG as a whole. Meeting locations would alternate between Silverton and Durango. Meetings of the CAG will be advertised and open to
  the public to attend.
