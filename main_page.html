  <h3>What is a CAG?</h3>
  <p class="pageContent">
    A Community Advisory Group (CAG) is made up of representatives of diverse community interests. Its purpose is to provide a public forum for community members to present and discuss their needs and concerns related to the Superfund
    decision-making process. A CAG can assist EPA in making better decisions on how to clean up a site. It offers EPA a unique opportunity to hear-and seriously consider-community preferences for site cleanup and remediation. However, the existence
    of a CAG does not eliminate the need for the Agency to keep the community informed about plans and decisions throughout the Superfund process.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p class="pageContent">
    Since the establishment of the Bonita Peak Mining District Superfund site (BPMD) there have been several conversations in the community on developing a Community Advisory Group (CAG) for the site. CAG’s are part of the Superfund law (CERCLA),
    but the CAG formation and operating procedures are left up to local communities. To be recognized as a CAG, a list of members is provided to EPA. EPA’s main criteria for approval is that members represent a diversity of interests within the
    community and that they live in the affected area (in this case within the watershed). While a CAG is strictly an advisory group to EPA, it still would serve as a more official, long-term mechanism for local citizens to engage with EPA and its
    partnering agencies than what exists today.<br><br>Our interest is in forming a CAG in Colorado regarding activities impacting the Animas River. We already represent a diversity of people who have been involved with water quality issues in the
    Animas Basin for many years. Over the past year, we have engaged the community in a very public process through the Citizen Superfund Workgroup to develop locally-generated desired outcomes for the Bonita Peak Superfund site. Those desired
    outcomes are enumerated in a memorandum to EPA. Formation of a CAG is a natural extension of the work done by the Citizen Superfund Workgroup.<br><br>CAG’s can fulfill different roles at different Superfund sites depending on community
    interests. The role of a CAG may change over time contingent on the stage of activity at a site and the interests of a potentially changing membership. One of the main objectives of this proposed CAG would be to disseminate information EPA
    produces to the community and to provide community input back to EPA.<br><br>Related to that objective, this CAG will assemble and utilize local expertise in reviewing and commenting on details within technical documents associated with this
    site. Characterization and mine remediation at the BPMD began twenty-five years before it was listed for Superfund in 2016. The community already possesses a great deal of data, knowledge and experience regarding the site. One of the main
    conditions that the San Juan County commissioners listed in their letter to the governor requesting Superfund listing was that EPA should consult and utilize local expertise in the characterization and remediation process. <br><br>The CAG will
    focus on BPMD mine remediation activities and their effects on the Animas River upstream of the Colorado border. It will not focus on the potential effects of Gold King mine water release which occurred August of 2015, a year before the
    Superfund listing.

  <h3>Formation</h3>
  <p class="pageContent">
    Representatives of four, locally coordinated Animas River watershed groups, together with the Animas River Keeper for the San Juan Citizens Alliance and the Community Liaison for San Juan County (CO) with EPA, are initiating this CAG formation
    process. All of these “formation committee” members have wide-ranging experience with Animas River issues, particularly water quality, and all have extensive contacts throughout the local community with which they can share information. The
    members of the CAG formation committee are:
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Peter Butler, Ph.D. – Coordinator – Animas River Stakeholders Group</li>
        <li>Ty Churchwell – Animas Campaign Coordinator – Trout Unlimited</li>
        <li>Curtis Hartenstine – Board Member – Animas Watershed Partnership</li>
        <li>Shannon Manfredi – Facilitator – Animas River Community Forum</li>
        <li>Marcel Gaztambide – Community Organizer – San Juan Citizens Alliance</li>
        <li>Anthony Edwards, J.D. – Community Liaison – San Juan County and Town of Silverton</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p class="pageContent">
    The formation committee is soliciting applications from people who want to be on the CAG, including applications from the formation committee itself. These applications would be forwarded the four local governments in the Colorado portion of
    the watershed – San Juan County (CO), Town of Silverton, La Plata County and the City of Durango. Each of these entities will pick one person from within their respective jurisdictions to be a CAG member. (The Southern Ute Indian Tribe was
    contacted to gage interest. A representative said that they would like to monitor the CAG activities but did not want to participate in the formation process.) Once those four CAG members are chosen, the formation committee will select the
    rest of the CAG members. We plan to limit the CAG to fifteen people. There is no set limit, but more than fifteen could become unwieldy. <a href="#getInvolved">Click here to submit an application.</a><br /><br />
    The CAG should have a diversity and balance of interests. Therefore, the committee will strive to appoint at least one person with experience in each of the following categories:
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Agriculture</li>
        <li>Mining</li>
        <li>Mine Remediation</li>
        <li>Recreation</li>
        <li>Environment</li>
        <li>Science</li>
        <li>Local Government</li>
        <li>Local Business</li>
        <li>Public Health</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p class="pageContent">
    We use the word “strive” because there may not always be a good candidate for each one of these categories. In addition, we want to ensure there are plenty of “at large” seats, because some good, qualified citizens may not fall under any of
    these groupings. The committee will also strive to obtain geographic representation from different parts of the Animas River watershed. CAG meetings are open to the public, so meeting participation is not limited to only CAG members. Community
    members and Animas River stakeholders are urged to participate.<br /><br />Generally, the term of appointments to the CAG would be three years with one-third of the appointments expiring each year. The members of the CAG as a whole would vote
    on appointments or re-appointments after the initial formation with the exception of the four members appointed by the local governmental jurisdictions.<br /><br />Operational bylaws such as developing a steering or executive committee,
    determining a quorum for meetings, taking actions (through vote or consensus), etc. would be developed by the CAG as a whole. Meeting locations would alternate between Silverton and Durango. Meetings of the CAG will be advertised and open to
    the public to attend.
